       Beta Sigma Psi is a National Lutheran Fraternity. We were originally founded
       at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the year of 1925.
       Since that date, we have spread to have 12 active chapters. We here at Eta Chapter
       were founded in 1952. Though originally located on the
       <a href="https://www.mst.edu" target="_blank">Missouri S&T<a/> campus,
       we moved and rebuilt our current house across Interstate-44 at 2 Fraternity Drive.
       We have also added a new addition that has nearly doubled the size of our house.
       <br><br>
       The men of Beta Sigma Psi pride ourselves in being Spiritually Based, Scholastically
       Superior, and Socially Involved. These three values were what our founding fathers
       built this Fraternity on and we still hold them dear to this day. Our organization
       is committed to providing a positive environment where Christian men can grow within
       these values. For more info on Beta Sigma Psi, click

      Beta Sigma Psi encourages its members to branch out and form new friendships. We hold socials
      here at our house with other fraternities, sororities, clubs, and sports teams. When we spend
      this valued time with others here on campus, we introduce ourselves to not only other great
      people, but also life long friends.
      <br><br>
      While being social with other students at Missouri S&T, we also have Brotherhood events inside
      our own house. These events can range from watching sports events together as a house,
      being involved in the St. Pat's competition, or spending a weekend at a service retreat.

      We are firm believers in practicing what we preach here at Beta Sig. Because of this,
      we as a house attend <a href="http://www.ilcrolla.org" target="_blank">Immanuel Lutheran Church</a>
      one Sunday a month. We understand that
      during our collegiate careers we will be extremely busy; however, we know that giving one
      Sunday to give back to our Lord will only strengthen our Faith. While we all attend church
      together, there are many opportunities for students to become more involved with their
      Lutheran Faith. Students can usher, greet, or even be a reader during the Church service.
      Along with this, many men in our house attend other bibles studies and Christian organizations.

      While here at school, we believe that our one goal, our one job, should be to graduate
      with superior grades. Through Beta Sig, we promise to help you do your best in ALL of your
      classes. Our study system keeps track of who is falling behind academically and fixes the
      problem before it is too late. Every members GPA is evaluated at both mid-terms, and the end
      of the semesters. Based on these GPA's, our scholastic chair in the house will place you on
      study hours if necessary, or allow you to act freely on your own with no guidance.
      <br><br>
      All Associate Members will be placed on immediate guidance upon joining the house.
      This is simply to help them get on the right track when starting college.
      A lot of us students that attend Missouri S&T are extremely intelligent students and
      have not had to study much in high school. This guidance program will help them understand
      their studying strengths, whether it's with groups or quietly and alone.
      <br><br>
      Lastly, one program that our house incorporates is the "Big Brother" Program. With this
      program, each incoming freshman will be assigned to an upperclassman roommate.
      This "Big Brother" will encourage good study habits, and will be available to help his
      "Little Brother" if he were to have any questions about the house, school, or life.
